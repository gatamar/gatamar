### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Currently I'm iOS/MacOS Software Engineer.
I believe that making software is a craft, it's neither science nor art. 

---

I am interested in the system design, TDD, performance, automation.
I hate making visual decisions - having requirements is preferable. 
I love Xcode IDE, actually that was the reason why I liked an Apple infrastructure.

I love StackOverflow, because it's a very strong community, and a huge Wiki of already solved problems.
